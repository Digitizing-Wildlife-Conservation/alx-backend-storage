MongoDB NoSQL Learning Project

Project By: Moses Muchai Lead Software Engineer DevOP's Enthusiast ALX SE Software Engineering @ Holberton Master Card Foundation.

This repository hosts tasks aimed at familiarizing oneself with MongoDB, a NoSQL database application. The tasks cover various operations such as listing databases, creating or using databases, inserting documents, querying documents, updating documents, and deleting documents within collections. Additionally, there are Python scripts included for performing similar operations using PyMongo, the Python driver for MongoDB. For instance, there are scripts for listing all documents in a collection, inserting new documents based on specific criteria, updating document attributes, and querying documents based on certain topics. Moreover, the repository includes scripts for analyzing logs stored in MongoDB, providing statistics such as the total number of logs, distribution of HTTP methods, and the top IPs accessing the server. These tasks serve as a practical guide for mastering MongoDB and its implementation in real-world scenarios. Feel free to explore and enhance your skills with MongoDB through this project.
