                         0x02. Redis basic Back-end Redis Cohort

This project, spearheaded by Moses Muchai, the Lead Software Engineer at Holberton ALX SE and a Software Engineering Master Card Foundation member, aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience on utilizing the Redis NoSQL data storage application through Python3. The tasks within the project are meticulously outlined to cover various aspects of Redis functionality. The initial task involves writing strings to Redis, with specifications on creating a Cache class, implementing a method to store data in Redis with a randomly generated key, and correctly type-annotating the method. Subsequently, the focus shifts to reading from Redis and recovering the original data type. This task entails creating a get method that retrieves data based on a provided key and an optional conversion function. Furthermore, two additional methods, get_str and get_int, are introduced to facilitate automatic parameterization for string and integer conversions respectively. The project ensures a hands-on approach to understanding Redis fundamentals, encouraging practical implementation and exploration.
